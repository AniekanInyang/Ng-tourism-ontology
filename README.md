# Ng-tourism-ontology
This an ontology project for tourism attractions around Nigeria
 
 # About 
 This project is a knowledge representation and reasoning project which focuses on the Nigerian tourism domain. The goal of this project is to have a large ontology of all tourism sites around the country, build a platform that can infer and recommend tourism sites based on inputs and user preferences.
 
 # How do I get started?
 This is an incomplete project and not yet ready for production, so please we are not accepting contributions yet. But you can clone this repo.
 To build the ontology, we use Protege 4.3 or a higher version with certain plugins installed (VOWL for Visualization, Pellet reasoner or any other preferrable reasoner can be used for inference, SPARL for queries and Debugger to highlight inconsitencies). SPARQl queries can be run on the ontology using Apache Jena Fuseki.
 For efficient running of this, adb=visable project minimum hardware requirements are: At least 2GB of RAM (Random Access Memory) size, 120GB of available Hard Disk space and at least 1.5GHZ of processor speed
